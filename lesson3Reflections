when would you want to create a repository rather than keeping all your work local?

pretty much when you want to store things carefully on the cloud... for backup
to collaborate with anyone not on your shared computer / network...

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
What if someone else is messing with the remote, you'd be getting trouble a lot
especially if they're editing a file you're also working on, things could change in the background in a way that you're entirely not ready to deal with.
Also, what about say, huge files, that you might only want to pull when you're connected to free wifi

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are only on github - they essentally make a copy in your repository linked to the original repository
Clones are full copies without any linking - they can be done locally or local from remote 
(I don't think you'd call a local to remote a clone - more like a push)
Branches share all of the commits up until the branch point - they can be local or remote,
