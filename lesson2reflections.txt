What happens when you initialize a repository? 
it creates the git framework inside of 
.git
in the main directory

Why do you need to do it?
to setup / configure git to be ready to do all the gitty things 
it shall do

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
Staging area only contains those files we choose for it to contain...
Working directory may contain many more files
Repository contains version history comments, other metadata,
    and also only stores things that have been added    

What value do you think it offers?
Staging allows you to, for instance not resend a 1gb data file with each commit, to have private log files / data / instances that aren't uploaded to a common server. To batch uploads, focusing on the relevant files each time
e.g. A & B are UX files one stage, C&D are backend second stage...
